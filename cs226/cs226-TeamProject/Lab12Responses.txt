Q1: The property makes initialization possible and runs the program
Q2: What changes is after the scope is changed to a singleton scope, all of the coin jars are #9,
this is because since there is one coin jar only the most recent name gets shown
Q3: We find Di/IoC to be very convenient in creating applications. Some notable advantages is that 
it allows us to create and run objects faster and it allows us to notice errors in testing. 
Some challenges for us would be that the focus splits between creating the dependency injection 
and managing the code. Testing is easier but programming to the interface is more challenging since we aren't use to it yet.
Q4: We didn't do the extra credit
